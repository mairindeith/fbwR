#' Run all steps of the FBW model using a HEC-ResSim run and biological parameters
#' 
#' @description
#' Using results from a HEC-ResSim hydrological model run and a set of biological
#' and dam operation parameters, `runFBW` performs all the steps of the dam passage
#' model. 
#' 
#' @details
#' FBW simulates dam passage of downstream migrants on a daily timestep. It requires
#' hydrological information be provided from a HEC-ResSim hydrological simulation model
#' run based on some dam operation rules. HEC-ResSim runs can represent status-quo dam 
#' management, or some operational alternative.
#' 
#' In addition to hydrological model results, FBW requires information about fish behaviour
#' and dam operating rules. Parameters are provided for a single "cohort" of downstream
#' migrants - included in a cohort are fish of approximately the same size, species, and fish 
#' passage behaviours. If there are multiple cohorts passing a dam, each could be parameterized
#' differently to reflect size- and species-specific passage behaviours and survival.
#' 
#' Briefly, the steps of the FBW model are: 
#' 1. From monthly run timing data, calculate the expected proportion of the cohort that
#' should pass in each day. The simulated period matches the period of record from the HEC-ResSim
#' model runs, and FBW simulates passage for each day included in the hydrological model outputs.
#' 2. In each day, calculate the proportion of fish which attempt to enter the dam but fail. 
#' Dam passage efficiency, DPE, is the proportion of fish which seek to enter the dam and succeed.
#' The 1-DPE component of the population is not modelled further with FBW (i.e. there are currently
#' no model processes reflecting in-reservoir survival and repeated attempts to pass after an
#' initial failure).
#' 3. Of those fish that successfully enter the dam, distribute them between available dam outlets. 
#' FBW is currently parameterized to include spillway gates, powerhouse turbines, regulating outlets, 
#' and several types of fish passage structures. Fish distribute between dam outlets according to
#' the distribution of flow and the relative attractiveness of each route.
#' 4. Once fish are distributed between outlets, calculate their survival (either as a point value
#' or as a function of flow through the outlet). In the case that there is a multi-gated outlet (e.g., 
#' a spillway with multiple gates or a powerhouse with multiple turbines), FBW accounts for how flow
#' distributes between gates according to dam operation rules. 
#' 5. (Optional) Summarize dam passage efficiency and route-specific survival from daily into annual 
#' passage metrics.
#' 
#' @param template_file Path to an Excel spreadsheet with standardized
#' inputs. One of `template_path` or `param_list` must be provided; if using
#' a template, it is loaded and translated into a parameter list like
#' `param_list`.
#' @param param_list Named list of FBW parameters created when the template
#' is read. This allows parameters to be modified or created manually without
#' having to create a separate template file. One of `template_path` or
#' `param_list` must be provided.
#' @param ressim_file File path to an Excel spreadsheet with ResSim inputs.
#'  One of `ressim_file` or `ressim` must be provided.
#' @param ressim A loaded file (e.g., using the `loadResSim` function)
#' which may be provided instead of `ressim_path`. One of `ressim` or
#' `ressim_file` must be provided.
#' @param ressim_wide Are ResSim data in typical wide format? Defaults to TRUE,
#' which assumes that each column in the dataframe contains data for a single
#' year, with each row representing a single day in the 365-day year.
#' @param summarize Should the daily outputs be summarized into average monthly
#' survival estimates? This summarizes across years within the period of record
#' in the ResSim input file.
#' @param verbose (Optional) Logical argument indicating whether to retain
#' intermediate calculation columns in the result. Intermediate calculations 
#' include the proportions of flow through each outlet, Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' 
#' @returns A dataframe which includes either daily estimates of fish passage and 
#' survival through dam outlets (if `summarize = FALSE`) or summaries of passage
#' after averaging across years in the period of record.
